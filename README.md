A simple JavaScript card game about digging bones out of a peat bog, with some Irish folklore thrown in. Inspired by the Ooblets dance battle system.

## Instructions:

Each player begins with 4 Brawn. <br>
Brawn is the energy you can use to dig. <br> 
Each turn you draw a hand of 4 cards. <br>
Each card has a Brawn cost. <br>

Cheer will increase the number of bones you find.

Fear will decrease the number of bones you find.
